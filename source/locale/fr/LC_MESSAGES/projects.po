"Projects are used to organize people and resources. CloudStack users within "
"a single domain can group themselves into project teams so they can "
"collaborate and share virtual resources such as VMs, snapshots, templates, "
"data disks, and IP addresses. CloudStack tracks resource usage per project "
"as well as per user, so the usage can be billed to either a user account or "
"a project. For example, a private cloud within a software company might have"
" all members of the QA department assigned to one project, so the company "
"can track the resources used in testing while the project members can more "
"easily isolate their efforts from other users of the same cloud"
