"The CloudStack administrator should monitor the total number of VM instances"
" in each cluster, and disable allocation to the cluster if the total is "
"approaching the maximum that the hypervisor can handle. Be sure to leave a "
"safety margin to allow for the possibility of one or more hosts failing, "
"which would increase the VM load on the other hosts as the VMs are "
"automatically redeployed. Consult the documentation for your chosen "
"hypervisor to find the maximum permitted number of VMs per host, then use "
"CloudStack global configuration settings to set this as the default limit. "
"Monitor the VM activity in each cluster at all times. Keep the total number "
"of VMs below a safe level that allows for the occasional host failure. For "
"example, if there are N hosts in the cluster, and you want to allow for one "
"host in the cluster to be down at any given time, the total number of VM "
"instances you can permit in the cluster is at most (N-1) \\* (per-host-"
"limit). Once a cluster reaches this number of VMs, use the CloudStack UI to "
"disable allocation of more VMs to the cluster."
