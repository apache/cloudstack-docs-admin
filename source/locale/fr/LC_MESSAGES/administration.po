"In addition to the physical and logical infrastructure of your cloud and the"
" CloudStack software and servers, you also need a layer of user services so "
"that people can actually make use of the cloud. This means not just a user "
"UI, but a set of options and resources that users can choose from, such as "
"templates for creating virtual machines, disk storage, and more. If you are "
"running a commercial service, you will be keeping track of what services and"
" resources users are consuming and charging them for that usage. Even if you"
" do not charge anything for people to use your cloud – say, if the users are"
" strictly internal to your organization, or just friends who are sharing "
"your cloud – you can still keep track of what services they use and how much"
" of them."
