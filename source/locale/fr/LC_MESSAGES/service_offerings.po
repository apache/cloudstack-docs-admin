"In addition to the physical and logical infrastructure of your cloud and the "

"people can actually make use of the cloud. This means not just a user UI, but a "
"set of options and resources that users can choose from, such as templates for "
"creating virtual machines, disk storage, and more. If you are running a "
"commercial service, you will be keeping track of what services and resources "
"users are consuming and charging them for that usage. Even if you do not charge "
"anything for people to use your cloud – say, if the users are strictly internal "
"to your organization, or just friends who are sharing your cloud – you can "
