"The figure below illustrates network setup within a single pod. The hosts "
"are connected to a pod-level switch. At a minimum, the hosts should have one"
" physical uplink to each switch. Bonded NICs are supported as well. The pod-"
"level switch is a pair of redundant gigabit switches with 10 G uplinks."
