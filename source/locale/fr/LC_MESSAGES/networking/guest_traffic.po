"Typically, the Management Server automatically creates a virtual router for "
"each network. A virtual router is a special virtual machine that runs on the"
" hosts. Each virtual router in an isolated network has three network "
"interfaces. If multiple public VLAN is used, the router will have multiple "
"public interfaces. Its eth0 interface serves as the gateway for the guest "
"traffic and has the IP address of 10.1.1.1. Its eth1 interface is used by "
"the system to configure the virtual router. Its eth2 interface is assigned a"
" public IP address for public traffic. If multiple public VLAN is used, the "
"router will have multiple public interfaces."

"The virtual router provides DHCP and will automatically assign an IP address"
