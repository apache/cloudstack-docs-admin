"Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) is an extension of load balancing "
"functionality, which is highly efficient in avoiding downtime. Based on the "
"nature of deployment, GSLB represents a set of technologies that is used "
"for various purposes, such as load sharing, disaster recovery, performance, "
"and legal obligations. With GSLB, workloads can be distributed across "
"multiple data centers situated at geographically separated locations. GSLB "
"can also provide an alternate location for accessing a resource in the "
"event of a failure, or to provide a means of shifting traffic easily to "
"simplify maintenance, or both."

"Global server load balancing is used to manage the traffic flow to a web "
"site hosted on two separate zones that ideally are in different geographic "
"locations. The following is an illustration of how GLSB functionality is "
"provided in CloudStack: An organization, xyztelco, has set up a public "
"cloud that spans two zones, Zone-1 and Zone-2, across geographically "
"separated data centers that are managed by CloudStack. Tenant-A of the "
"cloud launches a highly available solution by using xyztelco cloud. For "
"that purpose, they launch two instances each in both the zones: VM1 and VM2 "
"in Zone-1 and VM5 and VM6 in Zone-2. Tenant-A acquires a public IP, IP-1 in "
"Zone-1, and configures a load balancer rule to load balance the traffic "
"between VM1 and VM2 instances. CloudStack orchestrates setting up a virtual "
"server on the LB service provider in Zone-1. Virtual server 1 that is set "
"up on the LB service provider in Zone-1 represents a publicly accessible "
"virtual server that client reaches at IP-1. The client traffic to virtual "
"server 1 at IP-1 will be load balanced across VM1 and VM2 instances."

"Tenant-A acquires another public IP, IP-2 in Zone-2 and sets up a load "
"balancer rule to load balance the traffic between VM5 and VM6 instances. "
"Similarly in Zone-2, CloudStack orchestrates setting up a virtual server on "
"the LB service provider. Virtual server 2 that is setup on the LB service "
"provider in Zone-2 represents a publicly accessible virtual server that "
"client reaches at IP-2. The client traffic that reaches virtual server 2 at "
"IP-2 is load balanced across VM5 and VM6 instances. At this point Tenant-A "
"has the service enabled in both the zones, but has no means to set up a "
"disaster recovery plan if one of the zone fails. Additionally, there is no "
"way for Tenant-A to load balance the traffic intelligently to one of the "
"zones based on load, proximity and so on. The cloud administrator of "
"xyztelco provisions a GSLB service provider to both the zones. A GSLB "
"provider is typically an ADC that has the ability to act as an ADNS "
"(Authoritative Domain Name Server) and has the mechanism to monitor health "
"of virtual servers both at local and remote sites. The cloud admin enables "
"GSLB as a service to the tenants that use zones 1 and 2."
