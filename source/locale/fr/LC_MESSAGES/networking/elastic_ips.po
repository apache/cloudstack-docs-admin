"Elastic IP (EIP) addresses are the IP addresses that are associated with an "
"account, and act as static IP addresses. The account owner has the complete "
"control over the Elastic IP addresses that belong to the account. As an "
"account owner, you can allocate an Elastic IP to a VM of your choice from "
"the EIP pool of your account. Later if required you can reassign the IP "
"address to a different VM. This feature is extremely helpful during VM "
"failure. Instead of replacing the VM which is down, the IP address can be "
"reassigned to a new VM in your account."

"Similar to the public IP address, Elastic IP addresses are mapped to their "
"associated private IP addresses by using StaticNAT. The EIP service is "
"equipped with StaticNAT (1:1) service in an EIP-enabled basic zone. The "
"default network offering, DefaultSharedNetscalerEIPandELBNetworkOffering, "
"provides your network with EIP and ELB network services if a NetScaler "
"device is deployed in your zone. Consider the following illustration for "
"more details."

"In the illustration, a NetScaler appliance is the default entry or exit "
"point for the CloudStack instances, and firewall is the default entry or "
"exit point for the rest of the data center. Netscaler provides LB services "
"and staticNAT service to the guest networks. The guest traffic in the pods "
"and the Management Server are on different subnets / VLANs. The policy-"
"based routing in the data center core switch sends the public traffic "
"through the NetScaler, whereas the rest of the data center goes through the "
