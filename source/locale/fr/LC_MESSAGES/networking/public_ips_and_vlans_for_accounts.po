"CloudStack provides you the ability to reserve a set of public IP addresses "

" defining a set of VLANs and multiple public IP ranges. This feature extends"

"IP addresses for a tenant."

"Note that if an account has consumed all the VLANs and IPs dedicated to it, "
"the account can acquire two more resources from the system. CloudStack "
"provides the root admin with two configuration parameter to modify this "
"default behavior: use.system.public.ips and use.system.guest.vlans. These "
"global parameters enable the root admin to disallow an account from "
"acquiring public IPs and guest VLANs from the system, if the account has "
"dedicated resources and these dedicated resources have all been consumed. "
"Both these configurations are configurable at the account level."
