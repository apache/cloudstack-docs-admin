"The network that you can provision without having to deploy any VMs on it is"
" called a persistent network. A persistent network can be part of a VPC or a"
" non-VPC environment."

"When you create other types of network, a network is only a database entry "
"until the first VM is created on that network. When the first VM is created,"
" a VLAN ID is assigned and the network is provisioned. Also, when the last "
"VM is destroyed, the VLAN ID is released and the network is no longer "
"available. With the addition of persistent network, you will have the "
"ability to create a network in CloudStack in which physical devices can be "
"deployed without having to run any VMs. Additionally, you can deploy "
"physical devices on that network."

"One of the advantages of having a persistent network is that you can create "
"a VPC with a tier consisting of only physical devices. For example, you "
"might create a VPC for a three-tier application, deploy VMs for Web and "
"Application tier, and use physical machines for the Database tier. Another "
"use case is that if you are providing services by using physical hardware, "
"you can define the network as persistent and therefore even if all its VMs "
"are destroyed the services will not be discontinued."
