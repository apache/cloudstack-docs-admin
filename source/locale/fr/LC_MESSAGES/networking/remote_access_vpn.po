"CloudStack account owners can create virtual private networks (VPN) to "
"access their virtual machines. If the guest network is instantiated from "
"a network offering that offers the Remote Access VPN service, the virtual"
" router (based on the System VM) is used to provide the service. "
"CloudStack provides a L2TP-over-IPsec-based remote access VPN service to "
"guest virtual networks. Since each network gets its own virtual router, "
"VPNs are not shared across the networks. VPN clients native to `Windows, "
"Mac OS X <networking/using_remote_access.html>`_ and iOS can be used to "
"connect to the guest networks. The account owner can create and manage "
"users for their VPN. CloudStack does not use its account database for "
"this purpose but uses a separate table. The VPN user database is shared "
"across all the VPNs created by the account owner. All VPN users get "
"access to all VPNs created by the account owner."
