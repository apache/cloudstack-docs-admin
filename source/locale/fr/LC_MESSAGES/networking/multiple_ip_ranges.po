"CloudStack provides you with the flexibility to add guest IP ranges from "
"different subnets in Basic zones and security groups-enabled Advanced zones."
" For security groups-enabled Advanced zones, it implies multiple subnets can"
" be added to the same VLAN. With the addition of this feature, you will be "
"able to add IP address ranges from the same subnet or from a different one "
"when IP address are exhausted. This would in turn allows you to employ "
"higher number of subnets and thus reduce the address management overhead. To"
" support this feature, the capability of ``createVlanIpRange`` API is "
"extended to add IP ranges also from a different subnet."

"Ensure that you manually configure the gateway of the new subnet before "
"adding the IP range. Note that CloudStack supports only one gateway for a "
"subnet; overlapping subnets are not currently supported."

"Use the ``deleteVlanRange`` API to delete IP ranges. This operation fails if"
" an IP from the remove range is in use. If the remove range contains the IP "
"address on which the DHCP server is running, CloudStack acquires a new IP "
"from the same subnet. If no IP is available in the subnet, the remove "
"operation fails."
