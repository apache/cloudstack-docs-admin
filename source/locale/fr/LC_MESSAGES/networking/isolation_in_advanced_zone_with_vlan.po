"Isolation of guest traffic in shared networks can be achieved by using "
"Private VLANs (PVLAN). PVLANs provide Layer 2 isolation between ports within"
" the same VLAN. In a PVLAN-enabled shared network, a user VM cannot reach "
"other user VM though they can reach the DHCP server and gateway, this would "
"in turn allow users to control traffic within a network and help them deploy"
" multiple applications without communication between application as well as "
"prevent communication with other users' VMs."

"In an Ethernet switch, a VLAN is a broadcast domain where hosts can "
"establish direct communication with each another at Layer 2. Private VLAN is"
" designed as an extension of VLAN standard to add further segmentation of "
"the logical broadcast domain. A regular VLAN is a single broadcast domain, "
"whereas a private VLAN partitions a larger VLAN broadcast domain into "
"smaller sub-domains. A sub-domain is represented by a pair of VLANs: a "
"Primary VLAN and a Secondary VLAN. The original VLAN that is being divided "
"into smaller groups is called Primary, which implies that all VLAN pairs in "
"a private VLAN share the same Primary VLAN. All the secondary VLANs exist "
"only inside the Primary. Each Secondary VLAN has a specific VLAN ID "
"associated to it, which differentiates one sub-domain from another."
