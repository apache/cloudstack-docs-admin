"An event is essentially a significant or meaningful change in the state of "
"both virtual and physical resources associated with a cloud environment. "
"Events are used by monitoring systems, usage and billing systems, or any "
"other event-driven workflow systems to discern a pattern and make the right "
"business decision. In CloudStack an event could be a state change of virtual"
" or physical resources, an action performed by an user (action events), or "
"policy based events (alerts)."

"There are two types of events logged in the CloudStack Event Log. Standard "
"events log the success or failure of an event and can be used to identify "
"jobs or processes that have failed. There are also long running job events. "
"Events for asynchronous jobs log when a job is scheduled, when it starts, "
"and when it completes. Other long running synchronous jobs log when a job "
"starts, and when it completes. Long running synchronous and asynchronous "
"event logs can be used to gain more information on the status of a pending "
"job or can be used to identify a job that is hanging or has not started. The"
" following sections provide more information on these events.."

"Event notification framework provides a means for the Management Server "
"components to publish and subscribe to CloudStack events. Event notification"
" is achieved by implementing the concept of event bus abstraction in the "
"Management Server. An event bus is introduced in the Management Server that "
"allows the CloudStack components and extension plug-ins to subscribe to the "
"events by using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) client. In "
"CloudStack, a default implementation of event bus is provided as a plug-in "
"that uses the RabbitMQ AMQP client. The AMQP client pushes the published "
"events to a compatible AMQP server. Therefore all the CloudStack events are "
"published to an exchange in the AMQP server."

"A new event for state change, resource state change, is introduced as part "
"of Event notification framework. Every resource, such as user VM, volume, "
"NIC, network, public IP, snapshot, and template, is associated with a state "
"machine and generates events as part of the state change. That implies that "
"a change in the state of a resource results in a state change event, and the"
" event is published in the corresponding state machine on the event bus. All"
" the CloudStack events (alerts, action events, usage events) and the "
"additional category of resource state change events, are published on to the"
" events bus."
