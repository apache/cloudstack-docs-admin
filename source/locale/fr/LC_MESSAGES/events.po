"An event is essentially a significant or meaningful change in the state "
"of both virtual and physical resources associated with a cloud "
"environment. Events are used by monitoring systems, usage and billing "
"systems, or any other event-driven workflow systems to discern a pattern "
"and make the right business decision. In CloudStack an event could be a "
"state change of virtual or physical resources, an action performed by an "
"user (action events), or policy based events (alerts)."

"There are two types of events logged in the CloudStack Event Log. "
"Standard events log the success or failure of an event and can be used to"
" identify jobs or processes that have failed. There are also long running"
" job events. Events for asynchronous jobs log when a job is scheduled, "
"when it starts, and when it completes. Other long running synchronous "
"jobs log when a job starts, and when it completes. Long running "
"synchronous and asynchronous event logs can be used to gain more "
"information on the status of a pending job or can be used to identify a "
"job that is hanging or has not started. The following sections provide "
"more information on these events.."

"A new event for state change, resource state change, is introduced as "
"part of Event notification framework. Every resource, such as user VM, "
"volume, NIC, network, public IP, snapshot, and template, is associated "
"with a state machine and generates events as part of the state change. "
"That implies that a change in the state of a resource results in a state "
"change event, and the event is published in the corresponding state "
"machine on the event bus. All the CloudStack events (alerts, action "
"events, usage events) and the additional category of resource state "
"change events, are published on to the events bus."

"An event bus is introduced in the Management Server that allows the "
"CloudStack components and extension plug-ins to subscribe to the events "
"by using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) client. In "
"CloudStack, a default implementation of event bus is provided as a plug-"
"in that uses the RabbitMQ AMQP client. The AMQP client pushes the "
"published events to a compatible AMQP server. Therefore all the "
"CloudStack events are published to an exchange in the AMQP server."

"Publish and Subscribe notification service can be implemented as a "
