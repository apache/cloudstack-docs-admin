"Quota service, while allowing for scalability, will make sure that the "
"cloud is not exploited by attacks, careless use and program errors. To "
"address this problem, employ the quota-enforcement service that allows "
"resource usage within certain bounds as defined by policies and available"
" quotas for various entities. Quota service extends the functionality of "
"usage server to provide a measurement for the resources used by the "
"accounts and domains using a common unit referred to as cloud currency in"
" this document. It can be configured to ensure that your usage wonâ€™t "
"exceed the budget allocated to accounts/domain in cloud currency. It will"
" let user know how much of the cloud resources he is using. It will help "
"the cloud admins, if they want, to ensure that a user does not go beyond "
"his allocated quota. Per usage cycle if an account is found to be "
"exceeding its quota then it is locked. Locking an account means that it "
"will not be able to initiate a new resource allocation request, whether "
"it is more storage or an additional ip. To unlock an account you need to "
"add more credit to it. In case you want the locking to be disabled on "
"global or on account scope those provisions are also provided. Needless "
"to say quota service as well as any action on the account is "
"configurable."
