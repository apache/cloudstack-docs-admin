msgid "Using Tags to Organize Resources in the Cloud"
msgstr ""

#: ../../management.rst:23
msgid "A tag is a key-value pair that stores metadata about a resource in the cloud. Tags are useful for categorizing resources. For example, you can tag a user VM with a value that indicates the user's city of residence. In this case, the key would be \"city\" and the value might be \"Toronto\" or \"Tokyo.\" You can then request CloudStack to find all resources that have a given tag; for example, VMs for users in a given city."
msgstr ""

#: ../../management.rst:30
msgid "You can tag a user virtual machine, volume, snapshot, guest network, template, ISO, firewall rule, port forwarding rule, public IP address, security group, load balancer rule, project, VPC, network ACL, or static route. You can not tag a remote access VPN."
msgstr ""

#: ../../management.rst:35
msgid "You can work with tags through the UI or through the API commands createTags, deleteTags, and listTags. You can define multiple tags for each resource. There is no limit on the number of tags you can define. Each tag can be up to 255 characters long. Users can define tags on the resources they own, and administrators can define tags on any resources in the cloud."
