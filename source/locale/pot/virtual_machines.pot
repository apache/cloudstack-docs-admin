Be sure to leave a safety margin to allow for the possibility of one or more hosts failing, which would increase the VM load on the other hosts as the VMs are automatically redeployed. Consult the documentation for your chosen hypervisor to find the maximum permitted number of VMs per host, then use CloudStack global configuration settings to set this as the default limit. Monitor the VM activity in each cluster at all times. Keep the total number of VMs below a safe level that allows for the occasional host failure. For example, if there are N hosts in the cluster, and you want to allow for one host in the cluster to be down at any given time, the total number of VM instances you can permit in the cluster is at most (N-1) \\* (per-host-limit). Once a cluster reaches this number of VMs, use the CloudStack UI to disable allocation of more VMs to the cluster."

msgid "CloudStack can deploy guest VMs with Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or Virtual Graphics Processing Unit (vGPU) capabilities on XenServer hosts. At the time of VM deployment or at a later stage, you can assign a physical GPU ( known as GPU-passthrough) or a portion of a physical GPU card (vGPU) to a guest VM by changing the Service Offering. With this capability, the VMs running on CloudStack meet the intensive graphical processing requirement by means of the high computation power of GPU/vGPU, and CloudStack users can run multimedia rich applications, such as Auto-CAD, that they otherwise enjoy at their desk on a virtualized environment. CloudStack leverages the XenServer support for NVIDIA GRID Kepler 1 and 2 series to run GPU/vGPU enabled VMs. NVIDIA GRID cards allows sharing a single GPU cards among multiple VMs by creating vGPUs for each VM. With vGPU technology, the graphics commands from each VM are passed directly to the underlying dedicated GPU, without the intervention of the hypervisor. This allows the GPU hardware to be time-sliced and shared across multiple VMs. XenServer hosts use the GPU cards in following ways:"
