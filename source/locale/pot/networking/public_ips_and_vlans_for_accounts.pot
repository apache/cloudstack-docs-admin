msgid "CloudStack provides you the ability to reserve a set of public IP addresses and VLANs exclusively for an account. During zone creation, you can continue defining a set of VLANs and multiple public IP ranges. This feature extends the functionality to enable you to dedicate a fixed set of VLANs and guest IP addresses for a tenant."

msgid "Note that if an account has consumed all the VLANs and IPs dedicated to it, the account can acquire two more resources from the system. CloudStack provides the root admin with two configuration parameter to modify this default behavior: use.system.public.ips and use.system.guest.vlans. These global parameters enable the root admin to disallow an account from acquiring public IPs and guest VLANs from the system, if the account has dedicated resources and these dedicated resources have all been consumed. Both these configurations are configurable at the account level."
