msgid "CloudStack supports Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) functionalities to provide business continuity, and enable seamless resource movement within a CloudStack environment. CloudStack achieve this by extending its functionality of integrating with NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC), which also provides various GSLB capabilities, such as disaster recovery and load balancing. The DNS redirection technique is used to achieve GSLB in CloudStack."

The GSLB service provider is introduced that will provider the GSLB service. Currently, NetScaler is the supported GSLB provider in CloudStack. GSLB functionality works in an Active-Active data center environment."

msgid "Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) is an extension of load balancing functionality, which is highly efficient in avoiding downtime. Based on the nature of deployment, GSLB represents a set of technologies that is used for various purposes, such as load sharing, disaster recovery, performance, and legal obligations. With GSLB, workloads can be distributed across multiple data centers situated at geographically separated locations. GSLB can also provide an alternate location for accessing a resource in the event of a failure, or to provide a means of shifting traffic easily to simplify maintenance, or both."

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:55
msgid "**GSLB Site**: In CloudStack terminology, GSLB sites are represented by zones that are mapped to data centers, each of which has various network appliances. Each GSLB site is managed by a NetScaler appliance that is local to that site. Each of these appliances treats its own site as the local site and all other sites, managed by other appliances, as remote sites. It is the central entity in a GSLB deployment, and is represented by a name and an IP address."
msgstr ""

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:63
msgid "**GSLB Services**: A GSLB service is typically represented by a load balancing or content switching virtual server. In a GSLB environment, you can have a local as well as remote GSLB services. A local GSLB service represents a local load balancing or content switching virtual server. A remote GSLB service is the one configured at one of the other sites in the GSLB setup. At each site in the GSLB setup, you can create one local GSLB service and any number of remote GSLB services."
msgstr ""

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:72
msgid "**GSLB Virtual Servers**: A GSLB virtual server refers to one or more GSLB services and balances traffic between traffic across the VMs in multiple zones by using the CloudStack functionality. It evaluates the configured GSLB methods or algorithms to select a GSLB service to which to send the client requests. One or more virtual servers from different zones are bound to the GSLB virtual server. GSLB virtual server does not have a public IP associated with it, instead it will have a FQDN DNS name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:81
msgid "**Load Balancing or Content Switching Virtual Servers**: According to Citrix NetScaler terminology, a load balancing or content switching virtual server represents one or many servers on the local network. Clients send their requests to the load balancing or content switching virtual server's virtual IP (VIP) address, and the virtual server balances the load across the local servers. After a GSLB virtual server selects a GSLB service representing either a local or a remote load balancing or content switching virtual server, the client sends the request to that virtual server's VIP address."
msgstr ""

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:91
msgid "**DNS VIPs**: DNS virtual IP represents a load balancing DNS virtual server on the GSLB service provider. The DNS requests for domains for which the GSLB service provider is authoritative can be sent to a DNS VIP."
msgstr ""

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:96
msgid "**Authoritative DNS**: ADNS (Authoritative Domain Name Server) is a service that provides actual answer to DNS queries, such as web site IP address. In a GSLB environment, an ADNS service responds only to DNS requests for domains for which the GSLB service provider is authoritative. When an ADNS service is configured, the service provider owns that IP address and advertises it. When you create an ADNS service, the NetScaler responds to DNS queries on the configured ADNS service IP and port."

msgid "Global server load balancing is used to manage the traffic flow to a web site hosted on two separate zones that ideally are in different geographic locations. The following is an illustration of how GLSB functionality is provided in CloudStack: An organization, xyztelco, has set up a public cloud that spans two zones, Zone-1 and Zone-2, across geographically separated data centers that are managed by CloudStack. Tenant-A of the cloud launches a highly available solution by using xyztelco cloud. For that purpose, they launch two instances each in both the zones: VM1 and VM2 in Zone-1 and VM5 and VM6 in Zone-2. Tenant-A acquires a public IP, IP-1 in Zone-1, and configures a load balancer rule to load balance the traffic between VM1 and VM2 instances. CloudStack orchestrates setting up a virtual server on the LB service provider in Zone-1. Virtual server 1 that is set up on the LB service provider in Zone-1 represents a publicly accessible virtual server that client reaches at IP-1. The client traffic to virtual server 1 at IP-1 will be load balanced across VM1 and VM2 instances."
msgstr ""

#: ../../networking/global_server_load_balancing.rst:126
msgid "Tenant-A acquires another public IP, IP-2 in Zone-2 and sets up a load balancer rule to load balance the traffic between VM5 and VM6 instances. Similarly in Zone-2, CloudStack orchestrates setting up a virtual server on the LB service provider. Virtual server 2 that is setup on the LB service provider in Zone-2 represents a publicly accessible virtual server that client reaches at IP-2. The client traffic that reaches virtual server 2 at IP-2 is load balanced across VM5 and VM6 instances. At this point Tenant-A has the service enabled in both the zones, but has no means to set up a disaster recovery plan if one of the zone fails. Additionally, there is no way for Tenant-A to load balance the traffic intelligently to one of the zones based on load, proximity and so on. The cloud administrator of xyztelco provisions a GSLB service provider to both the zones. A GSLB provider is typically an ADC that has the ability to act as an ADNS (Authoritative Domain Name Server) and has the mechanism to monitor health of virtual servers both at local and remote sites. The cloud admin enables GSLB as a service to the tenants that use zones 1 and 2."

msgid "Tenant-A wishes to leverage the GSLB service provided by the xyztelco cloud. Tenant-A configures a GSLB rule to load balance traffic across virtual server 1 at Zone-1 and virtual server 2 at Zone-2. The domain name is provided as A.xyztelco.com. CloudStack orchestrates setting up GSLB virtual server 1 on the GSLB service provider at Zone-1. CloudStack binds virtual server 1 of Zone-1 and virtual server 2 of Zone-2 to GLSB virtual server 1. GSLB virtual server 1 is configured to start monitoring the health of virtual server 1 and 2 in Zone-1. CloudStack will also orchestrate setting up GSLB virtual server 2 on GSLB service provider at Zone-2. CloudStack will bind virtual server 1 of Zone-1 and virtual server 2 of Zone-2 to GLSB virtual server 2. GSLB virtual server 2 is configured to start monitoring the health of virtual server 1 and 2. CloudStack will bind the domain A.xyztelco.com to both the GSLB virtual server 1 and 2. At this point, Tenant-A service will be globally reachable at A.xyztelco.com. The private DNS server for the domain xyztelcom.com is configured by the admin out-of-band to resolve the domain A.xyztelco.com to the GSLB providers at both the zones, which are configured as ADNS for the domain A.xyztelco.com. A client when sends a DNS request to resolve A.xyztelcom.com, will eventually get DNS delegation to the address of GSLB providers at zone 1 and 2. A client DNS request will be received by the GSLB provider. The GSLB provider, depending on the domain for which it needs to resolve, will pick up the GSLB virtual server associated with the domain. Depending on the health of the virtual servers being load balanced, DNS request for the domain will be resolved to the public IP associated with the selected virtual server."
