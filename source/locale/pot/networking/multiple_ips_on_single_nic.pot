msgid "CloudStack provides you the ability to associate multiple private IP addresses per guest VM NIC. In addition to the primary IP, you can assign additional IPs to the guest VM NIC. This feature is supported on all the network configurations: Basic, Advanced, and VPC. Security Groups, Static NAT and Port forwarding services are supported on these additional IPs."

msgid "As always, you can specify an IP from the guest subnet; if not specified, an IP is automatically picked up from the guest VM subnet. You can view the IPs associated with for each guest VM NICs on the UI. You can apply NAT on these additional guest IPs by using network configuration option in the CloudStack UI. You must specify the NIC to which the IP should be associated."

msgid "Because multiple IPs can be associated per NIC, you are allowed to select a desired IP for the Port Forwarding and StaticNAT services. The default is the primary IP. To enable this functionality, an extra optional parameter 'vmguestip' is added to the Port forwarding and StaticNAT APIs (enableStaticNat, createIpForwardingRule) to indicate on what IP address NAT need to be configured. If vmguestip is passed, NAT is configured on the specified private IP of the VM. if not passed, NAT is configured on the primary IP of the VM."
