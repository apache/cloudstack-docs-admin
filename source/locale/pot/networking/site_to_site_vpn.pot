msgid "A Site-to-Site VPN connection helps you establish a secure connection from an enterprise datacenter to the cloud infrastructure. This allows users to access the guest VMs by establishing a VPN connection to the virtual router of the account from a device in the datacenter of the enterprise. You can also establish a secure connection between two VPC setups or high availability zones in your environment. Having this facility eliminates the need to establish VPN connections to individual VMs."

msgid "The difference from Remote VPN is that Site-to-site VPNs connects entire networks to each other, for example, connecting a branch office network to a company headquarters network. In a site-to-site VPN, hosts do not have VPN client software; they send and receive normal TCP/IP traffic through a VPN gateway."
