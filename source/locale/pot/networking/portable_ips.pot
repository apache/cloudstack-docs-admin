msgid "Portable IPs in CloudStack are region-level pool of IPs, which are elastic in nature, that can be transferred across geographically separated zones. As an administrator, you can provision a pool of portable public IPs at region level and are available for user consumption. The users can acquire portable IPs if admin has provisioned portable IPs at the region level they are part of. These IPs can be use for any service within an advanced zone. You can also use portable IPs for EIP services in basic zones."
