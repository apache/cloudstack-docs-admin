This virtual interface to physical interface mapping is done automatically by CloudStack using the traffic label settings for the Zone.

You can verify traffic using tcpdump on the virtual, physical and bridge interfaces."

Please note that these test would work only if your switches and traffic labels are configured correctly for your environment. If your SSVM/CPVM cant reach the Internet, its very unlikely that the Virtual Router (VR) can also the reach the Internet suggesting that its either a switching issue or incorrectly assigned traffic labels. Fix the SSVM/CPVM issues before you debug VR issues."

Go back and double check all your settings."
