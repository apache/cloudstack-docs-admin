"Elastic IP (EIP) addresses are the IP addresses that are associated with an "
"account, and act as static IP addresses. The account owner has the complete "
"control over the Elastic IP addresses that belong to the account. As an "
"account owner, you can allocate an Elastic IP to a VM of your choice from "
"the EIP pool of your account. Later if required you can reassign the IP "
"address to a different VM. This feature is extremely helpful during VM "
"failure. Instead of replacing the VM which is down, the IP address can be "
"reassigned to a new VM in your account."
msgstr "弹性IP（EIP）地址是指与帐户关联的IP地址，能起到静态IP地址的作用。帐户所有者能完全控制隶属于此账户的弹性IP。作为帐户拥有者，你可以从你帐户的EIP池中选择一个IP分配给虚拟机。如果后续需要，你可以继续分配此IP地址给另一个虚拟机。在VM宕机时，此功能特别有用。此IP地址可以重新指定给一个新的虚拟机，而不是取代已经宕机的虚拟机。"

"Similar to the public IP address, Elastic IP addresses are mapped to their "
"associated private IP addresses by using StaticNAT. The EIP service is "
"equipped with StaticNAT (1:1) service in an EIP-enabled basic zone. The "
"default network offering, DefaultSharedNetscalerEIPandELBNetworkOffering, "
"provides your network with EIP and ELB network services if a NetScaler "
"device is deployed in your zone. Consider the following illustration for "
